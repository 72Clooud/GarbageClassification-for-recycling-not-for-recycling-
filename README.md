# Garbage Classification with Keras and Flask
## Project Overview
This project is designed to classify waste as either recyclable or non-recyclable. It uses a Keras neural network model for image classification and Flask as the backend framework for serving a web interface. The goal is to improve the recycling process by automatically sorting waste into various categories, such as paper, plastic, glass, and more
## Features
- Classifies waste into 12 categories: paper, plastic, metal, glass (brown, green, white), shoes, clothes, batteries, organic waste, and other trash.
- Flask-based web app for uploading images of waste for classification.
- Uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for image classification.
- REST API support for easy integration with other systems.
## Technologies Used
- Python
- Keras – to build the neural network model.
- TensorFlow – as the backend for Keras.
- Flask – to run the web application.
- PIL – for image processing.
- Matplotlib – for visualization
- HTML/CSS – for the frontend interface.
